QUESTION7:-
What is the purpose of the key prop in a React component?

ANSWER:
The 'key' prop in a react component is used to identify which items have changed,been added, or been removed from the list.
This identification process enables react to efficiently update and render only the elements that need to be changed, rather than re-rendering the entire list.

purpose of the 'key' prop:-
1. Unique Identification: Each 'key' should be unique among siblings.React uses this key to track each element and it's associated data across renders.
2.Performance Optimization:By using keys, React can quickly determine which items in a list have changed, allowing it to re-render only those items rather than the entire list.This results in better performance, espicially for large lists.
3. Element Stability:Keys help maintain the identity of elements over time. This is particularly important for elements that have need to be preserved across re-renders.
