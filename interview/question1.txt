1. What is the difference between var, let, and const in JavaScript?

ans:
In Javascript,var,let and const are used to declare variables.
var:-
"var" is fuction scoped. That means variable can only be accessed within the function.Out of the function we can't access it.
if we have not declare a variable with "var" and want to print it will get the error like undefined.
example:-
var x=9;

let:-
"let" is block-scoped.This means that a variable declared with "let" is only available within the block(enclosed by'{}')in which it is declared.
we can't use the variable before it's declaration.
example:-
let s="java script";


const:-
"const" is also block-scoped,just like 'let'.
we can't use const variable witjout initilizing.
once we declare a variable with 'const' must be initilized at the time of declaration.
example:-
const m=24.8;
