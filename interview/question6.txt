QUESTION-6:-
How do you pass props to a React component?

ANSWER:-
In react, props(short for properties) are used to pass the data from a parent component to a child component.
props are read-only and provide a way to configure a child component with data component with or callback functions.
we can pass props to a functional component by providing attributes in the JSX when we render the component.
