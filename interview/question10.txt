QUESTION-10:-
How do you use React Hooks?
ANSWER:-
React Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components. 
Introduced in React 16.8, they allow you to use state and lifecycle methods without writing class components. 
By using hooks we can write cleaner,more maintainable and more functional components in react.


useState: For managing state in functional components.
useEffect: For handling side effects like fetching data, setting up subscriptions, and manually changing the DOM.
useContext: For accessing context values.
useReducer: For complex state logic or when the next state depends on the previous one.
useMemo: For memoizing expensive calculations.
useCallback: For memoizing callback functions
