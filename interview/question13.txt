QUESTION-13:

What is the purpose of the useContext() hook in React?
ANSWER:
The useContext hook in React is used to access the value of a context directly from a functional component. Context provides a way to share values (like themes, user authentication, or application settings) across your component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

Purpose of useContext
Access Context Values:

Allows you to consume context values within functional components without using the Context.Consumer component.
Simplify Context Usage:

Simplifies the process of accessing context values, making the code more readable and easier to manage compared to the traditional context API approach with Context.Consumer.
Eliminate Prop Drilling:

Provides a mechanism to avoid passing props through many layers of components, often referred to as "prop drilling."
